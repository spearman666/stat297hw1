Hello! My name is Ryan, [Here is a picture of me and a random dog i was swimming with this past summer!](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWTpi8pFWlB/?hl=en&taken-by=mompicsdaily). I love to study mathematics, watch and play sports, ski, listen to music and go to concerts, and last but not least, I love coding with R. It would be very hard for me to choose one hobby, but I guess I would have to choose skiing! I am in the PSU ski club, and for the past two years, I went on their winter break ski trip to Mont Tremblant in Quebec, Canada! What I love most about skiing is the combination of relaxation and extreme sport. The lift rides up the mountain are beautiful, quiet, and relaxing. And the trips down the mountain can be very treacherous and exciting! I love skiing through gladed trails, which basically means skiing down hill through the woods, it is a great workout and an indescribable experience.

*italics Hi, I'm Andrea. I don't really have much interesting hobbies, and kind of doing what all college students do. I do art and play piano sometimes. One interesting fact is that I'm international and passionate about education in developing countries, even if I'm a statistics major. *

## R Markdown Syntax

* cache problem
here is an example where the cache chunk option leads to an error 
```{r nicechunk}
a <- "apples"
```

```{r errorchunk, cache=T}
if(a == "apples"){
  a <- "bananas"
  sprintf("a is now equal to %s !", a)
}
```


if we change value of a in "nicechunk" to `a <- 4`, then "errorchunk" will produce a misleading message. To avoid this, we could use "dependson" argument in the "errorchunk"

* Simulate 100 random samples from a standard normal distribution using the function rnorm(). Store these 100 values in a vector called x. Then, compute the empirical median, mean and variance of x. Are these results different from 0, 0 and 1 (their respective theoretical values)? Is this result surprising? Justify your answer.
* Include a histogram of x.
```{r }
x <- rnorm(100)
x
mean(x)
median(x)
var(x)
#Justification: the mean, median and variance generated by a randomly selected 100 numbers are different each time, but they are all pretty close to 0, 0 and 1. One reason could be that R uses Linear congruential generator like many other programming languages, that each randomly generated number is related to the previous one. Even if the 100 numbers are different, their mean, median and varianc are still pretty similar.

hist(x)
```


* Include equation

$$\text{E}[\text{var} \{{ \upsilon_1 ({\hat{\theta}},n) | {\hat{\theta}} \}}] = \text{var} \{{ \upsilon_1 ({{\theta_0}},n)\}} + \text{E}[O_p \{\text{D}_1 (\theta^*,n)(\hat\theta - \theta_0),...,\text{D}_p (\theta^*,n)(\hat\theta - \theta_0) \}] \\= \text{var} \{{ \upsilon_1 ({{\theta_0}},n)\}} + O (n^{-2}). $$


* Include inline equation $A \equiv [a_i,j]_{i,j=1,...,p}$ .

* Include the following text in blue:

<span style="color:blue">“Vérité dans un temps, erreur dans un autre.”, Charles de Montesquieu</span>

* include a color box
<style>
div.blue pre { background-color:lightblue; }
div.blue pre.r { background-color:blue; }
</style>

<div class = "blue">
```{r bluecars}
#This is a very important message!
```

* include a button
